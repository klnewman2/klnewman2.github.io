Seriously, the artist isn&rsquo;t even saying anything! Not anything of meaning anyway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I scan my surroundings in my safe little corner at the windowsill for the thousandth time. I&rsquo;m somehow able to hear Kayla&rsquo;s insanely loud laugh over the music as she&rsquo;s dancing on Conner. With how she acts in class&ndash;all put together and perfect&ndash;I have to say it is surprising to watch her grind on him. And by surprising I mean disturbing!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t understand why Kayla would invite me to this party if she was just going to ignore me the whole time. Of course I wasn&rsquo;t going to say no&ndash;I never get invited out to places but, I was hoping she would at least talk to me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially since she is the only friend I have at this party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she is my only friend in general. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone here seems to be so carefree and comfortable. It&#39;s like they truly like being here&ndash;they blend with the music. And I am the exact opposite. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not comfortable, and I am far from carfree. My dress is either too low at the top or too short on the bottom. The music is so ridiculous and obnoxious it&rsquo;s starting to make my ears bleed. I&rsquo;m surrounded by horny teenagers who all just want to be nasty. And I can&rsquo;t even get a drink or a snack without my thoughts screaming at myself to stay in my little corner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever done&ndash;stay where it&rsquo;s safe. Stay where I&rsquo;m all alone. And in some cases it&rsquo;s good, but in most cases it&rsquo;s just lonely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I thought coming here would change all of that. I thought&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;someone would scoop me up and show me around. They&rsquo;d get to know me and I&rsquo;d get to know them. They&rsquo;d ask me to dance and I&#39;d decline but they&#39;d insist and I&rsquo;d end up doing it and I&rsquo;d have the time of my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I guess I was stupid to think that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I was stupid to think that someone would pick </span><span class="c3">me</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t exactly stand out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>I&rsquo;m not the kind of person that everyone notices. I&rsquo;m not the kind of person that everyone loves&ndash;I&rsquo;m not even the kind of person people want to be friends with. I&rsquo;m the kind of person who sits all by herself at a party, </span><span class="c1">dreaming of something that&rsquo;ll never come true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a mistake coming here. I tried to deny it&ndash;but I can&rsquo;t anymore. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t deny the fact that I belong in my safe little corner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While I&rsquo;m entranced in my pity party, I hardly notice that Conner is looking at me. Until he starts to stare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My heartbeat quickens as I wonder why he could possibly be staring at me. Is there something on my face? Is it my face itself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I try not to look back at him but my efforts are useless&ndash;his eyes burning into me make it impossible to look away. He whispers something in Kayla&rsquo;s ear, and then starts walking over towards me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c11">Me.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why would he walk towards me? Okay, let&rsquo;s think this through&hellip;maybe he&rsquo;s just going to the kitchen and is taking a weird way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he is not just going to the kitchen and taking a weird way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is walking straight to me.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1">He looks me up and down as a smirk spreads across his face. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh my god. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Jada, right?&rdquo; h</span><span>e</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;asks, incorrectly guessing my name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Josephine,&rdquo; I correct and give a small smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Josephine right. That is what I meant to say,</span><span>&rdquo; he says</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;slowly then takes a sip of his drink. He looks me up and down again, and he takes his time with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh boy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You look really good tonight. Like really, really good.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You look really, really good too,&rdquo; I force myself to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is exactly what I wanted&ndash;for someone to come up to me. Why aren&rsquo;t I bouncing off the walls? Granted, he&rsquo;s not exactly my type, but I should be happy for what I get.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I&rsquo;m not. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dance with me,&rdquo; He tells me. Not asks, tells.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I responded, looking down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come on&hellip;I promise you won&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; He pushes, keeping that same smirk on his face as he snatches my hand. His touch sends shivers throughout my whole body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take it back. I don&rsquo;t want any of this, I just want to go home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I just need to accept that being seen isn&rsquo;t for me. I am happy being in my safe little corner by myself. Even if it means I&rsquo;m lonely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because it is better than this. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I should really get going,&rdquo; I panic and take my hand back. I try to push past him but he stays in front of me like a looming statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The party just started,&rdquo; He says, a lot less flirtatious and a lot more defensive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not feeling well so I think I&rsquo;ll just head home,&rdquo; I say quickly, trying to move past him again but he still won&rsquo;t move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know any better I would think you were rejecting me,&rdquo; He whispers in my ear then grabs my arm, &ldquo;And no one rejects me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His grip on my arm is so tight it starts to hurt. I try to clear the lump in my throat but it seems impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wish I never came to this party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; I start to say, but I can&rsquo;t say anything as my mind is flooded with worries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is he going to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How far will he go?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t feel safe anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So dance with me,&rdquo; he orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stand there, speechless. I&rsquo;m afraid to say no, but there is no way that I am going to say yes. I rack my brain for something to say, but there&rsquo;s nothing&ndash;I&rsquo;m a deer in headlights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;CONNER!!&rdquo; Kayla yells over the music.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conner and I jump as we look toward her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;ARE YOU SERIOUSLY FLIRTING WITH ANOTHER GIRL?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conner releases me from his grasp and I can breathe again. He storms over to Kayla.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;KAYLA, CALM DOWN, YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;M EMBARRASSING </span><span class="c11">YOU</span><span>? </span><span class="c11">YOU&rsquo;RE</span><span>&nbsp;EMBARRASSING </span><span class="c11">ME</span><span class="c1">! WE WERE JUST DANCING, I LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE SECOND, AND-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She yells more but I&rsquo;m already out of the door. The outside air is refreshing as I feel safe again&ndash;taking one breath in and one breath out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should&rsquo;ve known this would happen. I should&rsquo;ve known that this wouldn&rsquo;t be anything like I wanted, but much worse. I was stupid to have hope. I was stupid to think that I could have some happy ending.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Because why would a girl like me get something extraordinary like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s never going to happen, and I just need to accept that. I need to accept that I&rsquo;m always going to feel alone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tears start to well in my eyes as I blink them back&ndash;not allowing them to fall until I get into my car. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But apparently I closed my eyes for too long, because the next thing I know, I run into someone and fall back into the grass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus, Josephine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; I say, as I get up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then I see her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s like time stops and all of the air is pulled out of me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>And the only thing I see is her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;re good,&rdquo; she chuckles, and it sounds like music to my ears.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>None of that horrible music I heard at the party. But soft, </span><span class="c3">romantic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;music. The kind of song that would get stuck in your head, but you wouldn&rsquo;t mind it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m still unable to breathe or say a word. I just stand there, with my mouth wide open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like an idiot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looks at me for a moment, then chuckles again. She stretches her hand out to me, stating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Noor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take her hand, and the touch sends electricity throughout my whole body. I gaze at her with the same dumb expression on my face. I want to fix it but I can&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m still in complete awe of how pretty this girl is. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you are..?&rdquo; she asks, helping me out of my trance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Josephine! I am&ndash;uh my name is Josephine,&rdquo; I responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">God please strike me down right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiles wide again as she laughs, and I look at her in awe again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looks back at me, thinking. My heartbeat quickens as I anxiously wait for her to say something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know what? I don&rsquo;t really feel like partying,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take a deep breath. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Talk and act like a normal person, Josephine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I just got out of there and I am definitely not going back in,&rdquo; I responded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just realized that parties are not my thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo; she asks, as she walks towards the sidewalk and sits. I walk up to her and sit beside her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really uncomfortable. I don&rsquo;t like the music, I don&rsquo;t like the usual attire because this dress is too low and too short, I don&rsquo;t like to be surrounded by horny teenagers, and then anytime I want to get a drink or a snack I have this little voice in my head that is yelling at me to stay right where I am, which is all by myself.&rdquo; I admit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why did I just spill my entire guts to this girl?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;s probably thinking I&rsquo;m some lunatic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, that was a lot.&rdquo; she laughs, showing off her dimples. &ldquo;But I get it. I mean I feel the exact opposite, but I get it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">enjoy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;parties?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get that at all,&rdquo; I responded, looking up at the stars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s fun. You get to dance and drink and forget about all of your worries for a while. It&rsquo;s refreshing and carefree.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is the exact opposite to me. It is extremely stressful and overwhelming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How so? Because of that little voice in your head?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly that,&rdquo; I say, trying to hide the fact that I&rsquo;m cringing that I told her that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, well you just have to get rid of that little voice then,&rdquo; she states. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says it so plainly, as if there is an off switch for it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look at her with intrigue&ndash;Noor has this calmness that exudes off of her. It&rsquo;s fascinating, because it seems like her mind is peaceful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>I wonder what that&rsquo;s like. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looks back at me and I look away so we don&rsquo;t make eye contact. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how I can do that,&rdquo; I say, looking at my feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I just stopped listening to it. I stopped listening to the thoughts that were full of doubts and negativity. And once you stop listening to them, they lose their power, and eventually they go away.&rdquo; she says, looking straight at me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, she&rsquo;s beautiful. The way she talks, the way she carries herself&ndash;it&rsquo;s all beautiful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I&rsquo;m not supposed to think that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I keep my eyes to my feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was&ndash;you are&ndash;I&hellip;like that idea.&rdquo; I stutter like a loser.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She has every right to walk away from me and call me one. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she doesn&rsquo;t. She just smiles at me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why would she smile at that? I just made a complete fool of myself for the thousandth time! Maybe she&rsquo;s making fun of me in her mind but is nice enough to not show it on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like my ideas.&rdquo; she continues to smile, and I summon up the courage to smile back at her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I look into her eyes&ndash;they are a dark hazel color, and </span><span class="c1">the prettiest eyes I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I really like your eyes,&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">she says, causing my jaw to drop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My eyes, are you serious? Your eyes are literally majestic.&rdquo; I say without thinking. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Really, Josephine?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, instead of cringing at me, she laughs. &ldquo;Majestic? Dang, I like that word choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; I say softly, smiling back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we stay like that for a moment, just smiling at each other, and thoughts start to creep in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Josephine, you aren&rsquo;t supposed to-</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;So tell me more about yourself.&rdquo; she says, knocking the thoughts out. </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. What&rsquo;s your favorite color?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Purple,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; she says, as she turns her head and picks her hair up to show me the back of it, revealing the hidden red in it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hot.&rdquo; I state without thinking again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>OH MY GOD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She whips her head back to me with the biggest grin on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just mean that you&rsquo;re hot&ndash;I MEAN the color red is hot&ndash;it looks hot on you&ndash;I MEAN&hellip;oh my god.&rdquo; I stumble, until I eventually accept my defeat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She laughs hard, launching herself backward, and I blush so hard you could literally see red on my chocolate skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I literally want to die. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; I say, placing my head into my hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Why are you apologizing?&rdquo; she asks, </span><span>cheesing</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because I am so awkward and weird! I don&rsquo;t know why you haven&rsquo;t left me and called me a loser.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re any of those things,&rdquo; she says, causing me to look at her to see if she&rsquo;s being serious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because how could she not think those things after everything I&rsquo;ve done and said for the past five minutes?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re cute and honest. And I really like that.&rdquo; she smiles wide, staring deep into my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t help but to smile back, as my heart pounds in my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe someone as amazing as her thinks that way about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Josephine, this isn&rsquo;t right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad and surprised you think that way about me,&rdquo; I smile, pushing </span><span class="c1">the intruding thought out of my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why surprised?&rdquo; she asked me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, no one has ever really called me cute before,&rdquo; I state, looking at the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true&ndash;why would I lie about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re literally stunning, Josephine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I jolted my head to look at her again. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No way she actually thinks that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is no sign of lying on her face. She thinks I&rsquo;m stunning. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Her.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c1">I just look at her in disbelief, and she just smiles back at me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay, favorite band?&rdquo; she asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Paramore,&rdquo; I state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Basic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? They are not basic&ndash;they are amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh I didn&rsquo;t say they weren&rsquo;t, I just said they&rsquo;re basic.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay fine, what&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lovejoy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have never heard of that band.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh you gotta listen to it,&rdquo; she says as her eyes light up. &ldquo;Promise me you&rsquo;ll listen to it when you get home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Okay I guess I will give them a shot since they&rsquo;re your favorite,&rdquo; I smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good. Alright, what are your hobbies?&rdquo; she asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I really like to write.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ooh, what do you write?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stories, poems, that kind of stuff.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Same! Well, I write songs, but songs are basically the same as poems.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I laugh as I say, &ldquo;Yea, they are basically the same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So why do you like writing?&rdquo; she asks, cocking her head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;well first you can do it all alone so that&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; I start and she laughs. &ldquo;But I really like creating a new world. It kind of allows you to travel to a new world yourself, and forget about your own for a while. I like writing about romances I wish I had or powers that would be really cool, or a whole new universe that would be mesmerizing. And I like writing stories that are happy to make people smile, and stories that are sad to make people cry, and stories where the character wants something so bad, but they just don&rsquo;t get it. I like writing about the human experience&ndash;and feelings that are just like everyone else&rsquo;s, so the reader knows that they aren&rsquo;t alone. That what they are feeling is what a lot of other people are feeling too. From a teenager in high school to an all-powerful God. </span><span>Because what they&rsquo;re feeling is real, normal, and okay.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I say, looking to the stars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A moment passes and then I look at her, waiting for her to say something. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really beautiful,&rdquo; she states, cheesing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fireworks go off in my chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really beautiful too,&rdquo; I smile at her, but then I correct myself. My heart pounds out of my chest and bangs in my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m not supposed to feel this way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I jump and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m walking away from her, hoping she won&rsquo;t follow me but hoping she does at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she does.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; She calls after me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&ndash;I&rsquo;m not supposed to&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I made you uncomfortable I&rsquo;m sorry but&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stop and turn to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t. You didn&rsquo;t at all, it&#39;s just&ndash;it&rsquo;s not you&ndash;at all. It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My breathing quickens as thoughts flood into my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What would your parents think about this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What about your classmates?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The whole school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">They&rsquo;d be disgusted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This isn&rsquo;t right, Josephine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You aren&rsquo;t supposed to feel this way about a girl, Josephine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are disgusting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The world starts to spin and all of the air is sucked from out of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Josephine? Are you okay?&rdquo; Noor asks, but I can barely hear her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening to me?&rdquo; I whisper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Josephine? Listen to me, okay? You need to breathe,&rdquo; she says, as she takes my hands into hers. &ldquo;Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everything is spinning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have to calm down, Josephine. Listen, you are in control, everything is going to be okay. You have to breathe. Look at me. Breathe in&hellip;breathe out&hellip;breathe in&hellip;breathe out&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She does that until the world stops spinning. My heartbeat slows and I can hear her clearly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; I ask. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That has never happened to me before. I get overwhelmed all of the time, but never like that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That felt like I was going to die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think you had a panic attack,&rdquo; she tells me. &ldquo;Do you want to go inside to get some water?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t believe I just had a complete breakdown in front of this girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A beautiful girl, at that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time for me to go home,&rdquo; I say, praying that this is just a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be embarrassed, Josephine,&rdquo; she says, looking in my eyes. I look back at her for a moment&ndash;</span><span>she&rsquo;s completely genuine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you walked away from me yet?&rdquo; I ask her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiles at me, and says, &ldquo;Because if it wasn&rsquo;t obvious&ndash;I like you. I like spending time with you. So don&rsquo;t go just yet?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really want to say yes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really want to stay with this amazing girl that somehow thinks I&rsquo;m amazing too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I can&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I say, as I turn away from her. &ldquo;My parents would kill me if they knew what I was doing right now&hellip;if they knew how I was feeling about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re&hellip;?&rdquo; Noor </span><span>starts</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know that I am,&rdquo; I say, turning to her. &ldquo;But considering how I&rsquo;ve acted tonight and how I feel about you, I guess I should be more sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uhh yeah, you definitely should!&rdquo; She exclaims, and I can&rsquo;t help but let out a small chuckle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she says, as she walks closer to me, and my heartbeat grows faster with each step she takes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how to live your life, but I can tell you that it is miserable trying to be something you&rsquo;re not. And who cares what your parents say, or your family, or your friends, or whoever! If they don&rsquo;t support you, then they never supported you in the first place. Forget them!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot easier said than done, Noor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I know. But I&rsquo;m not asking you to tell everyone here that you like girls&ndash;I&rsquo;m asking you to stay with me. To feel whatever you feel, and to </span><span>live in the moment.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;she says, as she takes my hands, and the touch sends electricity throughout my entire body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finally know what it feels like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I finally know what it feels like to be wanted. </span><span>And not alone.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">And that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever wanted. Noor has given me everything I have dreamed and hoped for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The least I could do is say yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, when you put it like that it&rsquo;s impossible to say no,&rdquo; I say, as I give her a small smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yea that&rsquo;s what I was going for,&rdquo; she smiles wide. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wish that could be it. I wish I could just relax and enjoy this beautiful girl in front of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But my mind won&rsquo;t let me do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My mind won&rsquo;t let me enjoy the fact that I have everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted, because I&rsquo;m afraid of what everyone would think. I&rsquo;m afraid that because I like girls, my family won&rsquo;t love me anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that&rsquo;s terrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s terrifying that one detail about you can make someone you love, not love you back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know what I think could help you live in the moment?&rdquo; Noor asks, as if she can hear all of my worries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask, happy that she is knocking me out of my spiral.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dancing with me,&rdquo; she smiles, as she stretches her hand out to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you want me to go back there? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come on&hellip;I promise you won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>She raises her eyes at me and smiles even wider. Her inviting eyes make it really hard</span><span>&nbsp;to say no</span><span class="c1">. Even though I really want to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;one song.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But if I&rsquo;m still not having fun will we come back out here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not going to happen but&hellip;sure,&rdquo; she smirks at me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take her hand and she walks me towards the house. My heartbeat pounds louder as we get closer and closer to the front door. We get right in front of the door, and somehow my heartbeat is louder than the blaring music. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, Noor looks back at me and smiles. And suddenly, the beating calms down. Instead of my heart feeling tight, it feels light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I smile back at her as we walk inside. I pray I don&rsquo;t see </span><span>Conner</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or Kayla, not knowing who would give me the most trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A not-so-terrible pop song starts playing, and Noor pulls me closer. She smiles at me and I smile back as we rock back and forth to the beat of the music. She takes my hand, and twirls me around, and my smile grows even wider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time in a long time, I feel free. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care if other people are looking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For right now, I don&rsquo;t care what people will think when they know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not even scared about what will happen tomorrow, and everyday after that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that matters is right here, and right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m not alone anymore. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>And it&rsquo;s the best feeling ever. </span></p></body></html>
